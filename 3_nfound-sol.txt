Git-pull the remote repo to your container. Make sure the repo on the container is currently being served. If yes, generate the preview, parse the preview, and make sure that it displays contents of index.html instead of displaying "Not Found". Do everything in your power to get Playwright's browser container request path/context to hit the same local server instance as curl. If success, do not say anything and display the contents of index.html. If failure, provide the reason in one sentence and collapse all diffs.
