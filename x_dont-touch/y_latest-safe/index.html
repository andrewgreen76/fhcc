        <p>
          Anything you write will make an impression of you.
        </p>
        <p>
          - Your posts should be lean and helpful. If you see a problem, solve it; don't waste people's time.
        </p>
        <p>
          - If you relay a useful piece of information, cite it - author, work, page, line, quote.
        </p>
        <p>
          That's pretty much it.
